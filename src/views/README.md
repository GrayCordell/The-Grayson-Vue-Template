# Views

The project comprises multiple views, each representing a distinct visual area and corresponding to a specific aspect of the project. These views serve as the main pages loaded in the router-view and essentially function as standalone pages.

Below are some example views:

- **MapView**: The primary page that displays the map.
- **QuizView**: A panel used for conducting quizzes.

Please note that **NoteFloat** may not strictly qualify as a view. Previously, it existed as a standalone page but is expected to be relocated in the future to enhance organizational structure.
